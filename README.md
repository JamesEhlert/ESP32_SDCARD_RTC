# ESP32_SDCARD_RTC
This project is a temperature and humidity monitoring system built using ESP32, a Real-Time Clock (RTC) module, and an SD card module. It allows you to monitor temperature and humidity levels in real-time and log the data onto an SD card for later analysis. The system also features an OLED display to provide real-time feedback.
